# Job Search Application README

This application is a job search application developed using the Java Swing framework, PostgreSql, SQL. Below, you can find the necessary steps to use the application.

## Getting Started

### Adding Libraries
- The application utilizes the Java Swing framework for developing graphical user interfaces in Java. To include this framework in your project, you need to import the necessary classes.

    - Additionally, make sure to include the `jcalender-1.4.jar` library located in the `lib` folder of your project.


### Creating the Database
- PostgreSQL is used for the database. You should create a database to connect to PostgreSQL. For example, create a database named "find_job_db."

### Building the Database
- Use the `G13_DDL.sql` file to build your database. This file defines the necessary tables and relationships.

### Configuring the Database Settings
- Update the database connection settings in the `FindJob.java` file according to your PostgreSQL database information.

## Usage

After completing these steps, you can run the application by following the steps below:

1. Run the `FindJob.java` file to start the application.
2. Once the application is launched, you can perform job search and application processes.

That's it! Now you can use your job search application. Good luck!
